1:   Vertex positions in Halo 2 seem to have three stored formats: one format is simply a vector3 
     for position (stored as int16s¹):
     
     short x;
     short y;
     short z;
     ...

2:   the second format is the same as before plus a short which is an index into the bone_map table at the 
     end of the raw data:
     
     ...
     byte bone0;
     padding_byte;

4:   06-0C 
	 another multi-node format

	 ...
	 short padding; //(?)
	 byte bone0;
	 byte bone1;
	 byte weight1;
	 byte weight2;

3:   08-0C
	 and finally the third is the same as the frist plus: two bytes followed by two short values which 
     represent the 'weight' of each bone:
     
     ...
     byte bone0;
     byte bone1;
	 byte bone2;
     short weight1;
     short weight2;
	 short weight2;
